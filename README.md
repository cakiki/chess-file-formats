# chess-db-formats

A collection of [Kaitai Structs](https://kaitai.io/) to parse binary chess tablebases, databases, and miscellaneous binary file formats.

You can use a given format's `.ksy` file to generate a parser for that format in any of the languages supported by Kaitai, which currently includes:

- C++
- C#
- Go
- Java
- JavaScript
- Lua
- Nim
- Perl
- PHP
- Python
- Ruby
- Rust

Feel free to submit a PR with a Kaitai parser for any format you like, or open an issue to suggest formats you'd like parsers for.
