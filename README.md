# Chess File Formats

A collection of utilities and [Kaitai Structs](https://kaitai.io/) to parse binary chess tablebases, databases, and miscellaneous binary file formats.

You can use a given format's `.ksy` file to generate a parser for that format in any of the languages supported by Kaitai, which currently includes **C++**, **C#**, **Go**, **Java**, **JavaScript**, **Lua**, **Nim**, **Perl**, **PHP**, **Python**, **Ruby**, and **Rust**.

Feel free to submit a PR with a parser for any format you like, or open an issue to suggest formats you'd like parsers for.
